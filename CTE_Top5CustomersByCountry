SQL Query Refactoring with CTEs: Analyzing Top 5 Customer Distribution by Country
This query uses CTEs to first count all customers per country, then identify the top 5 highest-paying customers. 
It combines both to analyze how top spenders are distributed across countries, enabling a comparison between overall customer base and high-value customers.

WITH country_list AS (
    SELECT 
        country.country,
        COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count

    INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
    INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
    GROUP BY country.country
),
